Proof-of-renewable-energy-production (PoREP)

Every time a certain amount of renewable energy is produced, a node is allowed to add a new block to the PoREP based blockchain. This consensus mechnism should overcome some of the major limitations of the proof-of-work consensus protocol, like waste of energy and waste of hardware. PoREP forces the participating nodes to invest into something usefull, namely renewable energy power plants and not into specialiced mining hardware, which are worthless beside the very fast hash creation. Oracles can be used to observe the amout of renewable produced energy at a site. Another way of observing the correct amount of produced renewable energy is by relying on trusted execution environments. If several nodes are sending new blocks at almost the same time, then the blockchain forks, like in conventional blockchains.
