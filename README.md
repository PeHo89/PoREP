Proof-of-renewable-energy-production

Every time a certain amount of renewable energy is produced, a node is allowed to add a new block to the blockchain. This consensus mechnism should overcome some of the major limitations of the proof-of-work consensus protocol, like waste of energy and waste of hardware. PoREP forces the participating nodes to invest into something usefull, namely renewable energy power plants and not into specialiced mining hardware, which are worthless beside the very fast hash creation. Oracles are used to observe the amout of renewable produced energy at a site.
